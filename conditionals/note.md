there are conditionals operators:
 <,>,<=,>=,!=

If: this keyword is use to take output between two conditions
- eg:  x=3
-      y=4
-     if(x<y):
-     ....print('yes')
we use identitions in if-conditions as shown above in dots.it is use instead of {} any other languages.

elif: it is also use if conditions to improve program faster and good and it is use as
- eg:  x=3
-      y=4
-     if(x<y):
-     ....print('yes')
-     elif(x>y):
-     ....print('good')

else: it is use to end the conditions at a last.

or: this keywords is use to take conditions like
-   if(x>y or x<y):
-   ....print('x not equal to y')
